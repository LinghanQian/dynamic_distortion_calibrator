Automatic distortion calibration of any to the connected camera

this project was created with the project generator of openframeworks v0.9.8 . to compile the code open the project generator of openframeworks and import the project into the generator. After updating that you should be able to compile the code.

Our project actually shows a spiral form moving pixel which grows if the connected camera doesn't recognize any blobs. Next we wan't to add a function that saves the recognized position of the pixel on the screen at the camera frame and simultaneously adds the real position on the screen where the pixel was placed.
